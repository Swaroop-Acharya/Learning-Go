1. Go lets us to create huge constant — so big you can’t even fit it into normal int types.
But Go lets it exist as a constant safely because it’s not stored in memory yet — it’s only calculated when needed.

2. Defer statement features
3. expressions in if statement
4. Switch statements
5. Slices in array, Slices are like references to arrays. Changing the vales
  of slice modifies tthe corresponding elements of its underlying array.
6. The zero value of map is nil. A nil map has no keys, nor can keys be added.
7. Function closures
8. Methods vs Functions
9. The fmt package has special logic.
   When it sees an interface value being printed, it checks:
  1. Does it implement the fmt.Stringer interface?
    (which has String() string)

  2. If not, does it implement the error interface?
   (which has Error() string)

  3. If yes → it calls the Error() method automatically to get the string to print.
